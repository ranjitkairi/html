CSS Margins
The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

Margin - Individual Sides
CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
All the margin properties can have the following values:

auto - the browser calculates the margin
length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element
Tip: Negative values are allowed.

Example
Set different margins for all four sides of a <p> element: */

p {
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 100px;
  margin-right: 150px;
  margin-left: 80px;
}

Margin - Shorthand Property
To shorten the code, it is possible to specify all the margin properties in one property.

/* The margin property is a shorthand property for the following individual margin properties:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
So, here is how it works:

If the margin property has four values:

margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
top margin is 25px
right margin is 50px
bottom margin is 75px
left margin is 100px
Example
Use the margin shorthand property with four values: */

p {
  margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
}
