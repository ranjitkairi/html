/* 

What is !important?
The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.

In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!

Let us look at an example:

Example */

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#myid {
  background-color: blue;
}

.myclass {
  background-color: gray;
}

p {
  background-color: red !important;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p>This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

<p class="myclass">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

<p id="myid">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

/* 
Maybe One or Two Fair Uses of !important
One way to use !important is if you have to override a style that cannot be overridden in any other way. This could be if you are working on a Content Management System (CMS) and cannot edit the CSS code. Then you can set some custom styles to override some of the CMS styles.

Another way to use !important is: Assume you want a special look for all buttons on a page. Here, buttons are styled with a gray background color, white text, and some padding and border:

Example */

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.button {
  background-color: #8c8c8c; 
  color: white;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid black; 
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
