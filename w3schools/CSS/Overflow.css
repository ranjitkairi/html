/* 
CSS Overflow
The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

The overflow property has the following values:

visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary */

/* overflow: visible
By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:

You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
Example */
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: #eee;
  overflow: visible;
}

/* overflow: hidden
With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is hidden:

div {
  overflow: hidden;
