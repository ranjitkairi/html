<!-- HTML Images Syntax
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
Syntax -->
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">

<!-- The src Attribute
The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

Note: When a web page loads; it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.

Example -->
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">

<!-- The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:

Example -->
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">



<!-- Image Size - Width and Height
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.

Example -->
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">

<!-- The width and height attributes always define the width and height of the image in pixels. -->


<!-- Width and Height, or Style?
The width, height, and style attributes are all valid in HTML.

However, we suggest using the style attribute. It prevents styles sheets from changing the size of images:

Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
img {
  width: 100%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" width="128" height="128">

<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">

</body>
</html>

<!-- Images in Another Folder
If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute:

Example -->
<img src="/images/html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">

<!-- Images on Another Server/Website
Some web sites point to an image on another server.

To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:

Example -->
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com">


<!-- Animated Images
HTML allows animated GIFs:

Example -->
<img src="programming.gif" alt="Computer Man" style="width:48px;height:48px;">

<!-- Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

Example -->
<a href="default.asp">
  <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>

<!-- Image Floating
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text:

Example -->
<p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;">
The image will float to the right of the text.</p>

<p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:left;width:42px;height:42px;">
The image will float to the left of the text.</p>

<!-- Common Image Formats
Here are the most common image file types, which are supported in all browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera):

**Abbreviation	File Format	File Extension**
APNG--->Animated Portable Network Graphics-->.apng
GIF---->Graphics Interchange Format-->.gif
ICO---->Microsoft Icon-->.ico, .cur
JPEG--->Joint Photographic Expert Group image-->.jpg, .jpeg, .jfif, .pjpeg, .pjp
PNG---->Portable Network Graphics-->.png
SVG---->Scalable Vector Graphics-->.svg -->

<!-- Image Maps
The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The areas are defined with one or more <area> tags.

Try to click on the computer, phone, or the cup of coffee in the image below:

Workplace
Example
Here is the HTML source code for the image map above: -->

<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">

<map name="workmap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
  <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="phone.htm">
  <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Coffee" href="coffee.htm">
</map>

<!-- How Does it Work?
The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.

To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas. -->


<!-- The Image
The image is inserted using the <img> tag. The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute: -->

<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">
<!-- The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.
 -->

 <!-- Create Image Map
Then, add a <map> element.

The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute: -->

<map name="workmap">
<!-- The name attribute must have the same value as the <img>'s usemap attribute . -->


<!-- The Areas
Then, add the clickable areas.

A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.

Shape
You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:

rect - defines a rectangular region
circle - defines a circular region
poly - defines a polygonal region
default - defines the entire region -->


<!-- Shape="rect"
The coordinates for shape="rect" come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis.

So, the coordinates 34,44 is located 34 pixels from the left margin and 44 pixels from the top:

Workplace
The coordinates 270,350 is located 270 pixels from the left margin and 350 pixels from the top:

Workplace
Now we have enough data to create a clickable rectangular area:

Example -->
<area shape="rect" coords="34, 44, 270, 350" href="computer.htm">
