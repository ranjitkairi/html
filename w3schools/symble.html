<!-- HTML Symbols
Symbols that are not present on your keyboard can also be added by using entities.

HTML Symbol Entities
HTML entities were described in the previous chapter.

Many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard.

To add such symbols to an HTML page, you can use the entity name or the entity number (a decimal or a hexadecimal reference) for the symbol.

Example
Display the euro sign, €, with an entity name, a decimal, and a hexadecimal value:

<p>I will display &euro;</p>
<p>I will display &#8364;</p>
<p>I will display &#x20AC;</p>
Will display as:
I will display €
I will display €
I will display € -->
