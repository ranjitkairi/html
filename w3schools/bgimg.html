<!-- Background Image on a HTML element
To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property:

Example
Add a background image on a HTML element: -->

<div style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg')">
  <!-- To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to no-repeat.

Example -->
  <style>
    body {
      background-image: url("example_img_girl.jpg");
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
    }
  </style>

  <!-- Background Cover
If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.

Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed:

This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):

Example -->
  <style>
    body {
      background-image: url("img_girl.jpg");
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-attachment: fixed;
      background-size: cover;
    }
  </style>

  <!-- Background Stretch
If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property to 100% 100%:

Try resizing the browser window, and you will see that the image will stretch, but always cover the entire element.

Example -->
  <style>
    body {
      background-image: url("img_girl.jpg");
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-attachment: fixed;
      background-size: 100% 100%;
    }
  </style>
</div>
