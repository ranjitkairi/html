Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.
HTML Entities
Some characters are reserved in HTML.
If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.
Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
A character entity looks like this:
&entity_name;
OR
&#entity_number;
To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60; -->


<!-- Non-breaking Space
A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;
A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.
Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.

Examples:

ยง 10
10 km/h
10 PM
Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages.
If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the &nbsp; character entity.
