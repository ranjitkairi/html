Using Emojis in HTML
Emojis are characters from the UTF-8 character set: 😄 😍 💗

What are Emojis?
Emojis look like images, or icons, but they are not.

They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) character set.

UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world. -->

<!-- The HTML charset Attribute
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.

This is specified in the <meta> tag: -->

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<!-- If not specified, UTF-8 is the default character set in HTML. -->

<!-- UTF-8 EXAMPLES -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>

<p>I will display A B C</p>
<p>I will display &#65; &#66; &#67;</p>

</body>
</html>
