HTML Style Guide and Coding Conventions
A consistent, clean, and tidy HTML code makes it easier for others to read and understand your code.
Here are some guidelines and tips for creating good HTML code.

 <!-- Always Declare Document Type
Always declare the document type as the first line in your document.
The correct document type for HTML is:
<!DOCTYPE html> -->

<!-- Use Lowercase Element Names
HTML allows mixing uppercase and lowercase letters in element names.
However, we recommend using lowercase element names, because:
Mixing uppercase and lowercase names looks bad
Developers normally use lowercase names
Lowercase looks cleaner
Lowercase is easier to write -->

<!-- Good: -->
<body>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
<!-- Bad: -->
<BODY>
<P>This is a paragraph.</P>
</BODY>
